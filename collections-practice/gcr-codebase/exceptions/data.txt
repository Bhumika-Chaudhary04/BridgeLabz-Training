Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance automatically without being explicitly programmed.

Simple definition (easy to remember):

Machine Learning is a technique where machines learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions on their own.

Technical definition:

Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that allow systems to learn from experience (data) and improve their accuracy over time.

Example:

Email spam filter learns which emails are spam by analyzing past emails.

Netflix/YouTube recommendations learn from your watch history.

Face recognition systems learn facial features from images.
